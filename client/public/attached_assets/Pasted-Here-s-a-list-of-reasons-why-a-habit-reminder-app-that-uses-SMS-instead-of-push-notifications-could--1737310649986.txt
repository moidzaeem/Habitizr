Hereâ€™s a list of reasons why a habit reminder app that uses SMS instead of push notifications could be more beneficial:

1. Higher Open and Read Rates
SMS: The open rate for SMS messages is around 98%, with most messages read within 3 minutes of delivery.
Push Notifications: The average open rate is significantly lower, at about 20-40%, depending on the platform and app engagement.
2. No Internet Requirement
SMS: SMS messages work even without internet access, making them reliable in areas with poor connectivity or for users who don't have data plans.
Push Notifications: Require a stable internet connection to be delivered and accessed.
3. Less Likely to Be Ignored
SMS: Messages are delivered directly to the user's inbox and are less likely to be ignored, as SMS is typically associated with personal and urgent communication.
Push Notifications: Often get lost in the sea of app notifications or are dismissed without reading.
4. Works Across All Devices
SMS: Compatible with any mobile device, including feature phones, ensuring accessibility for a broader audience.
Push Notifications: Require smartphones with apps installed and notifications enabled.
5. Avoids Notification Fatigue
SMS: SMS messages are less frequent and are often perceived as more deliberate and important.
Push Notifications: Can contribute to notification fatigue, leading users to disable them entirely or uninstall the app.
6. Better for Time-Sensitive Reminders
SMS: Due to the high read rate and immediacy, SMS is ideal for time-sensitive habit reminders, ensuring the message reaches the user promptly.
Push Notifications: May be delayed or dismissed without acknowledgment.
7. User Trust and Perceived Importance
SMS: Users perceive SMS messages as more personal and important since they are typically used for critical communication like bank alerts, appointment reminders, and personal messages.
Push Notifications: Can be seen as less important or spammy, depending on the user's experience with app notifications.
8. No App Installation Required
SMS: Allows users to receive reminders without installing an app, making it more accessible to those who prefer minimal app usage.
Push Notifications: Require the app to be installed and notifications to be enabled, which is a barrier for some users.
9. Lower Risk of Being Blocked or Muted
SMS: While users can block a number, they are less likely to do so for a useful habit reminder.
Push Notifications: Many users actively mute app notifications or disable them altogether, rendering them ineffective.
10. Global Reach
SMS: Can reach any user with a mobile phone number worldwide, making it ideal for apps with a global audience.
Push Notifications: Dependent on specific ecosystems (iOS, Android) and are subject to app store restrictions.
11. Data Privacy and Security
SMS: Does not require users to share their app data or depend on third-party app ecosystems, which could make users feel safer.
Push Notifications: Often linked to app usage, raising concerns about privacy and tracking.
12. Engagement Without App Dependence
SMS: Keeps users engaged with the habit reminder system without requiring frequent app interaction.
Push Notifications: Rely on app engagement, which may decline over time as interest wanes.
By leveraging the strengths of SMS, a habit reminder app can ensure higher effectiveness and broader accessibility, making it a superior choice for users who value reliability and simplicity.
